# About Us

The Blockchain Society is a student run organization at the University of Washington that brings together all of the blockchain and cryptocurrency clubs from all three UW campuses to serve the students and the crypto communities around the Seattle and Tacoma areas. The society is made up of students from all three campuses, including faculty members and business professionals. The Blockchain Society will plan to organize conferences and educational events for students to explore general concepts and the underlying tech associated with the blockchain. This organization will establish the framework necessary to implement a well-structured curriculum that will progress into a official major and allow UW to be innovators in the blockchain space.This group brings together not only the officers, but the student and alumni members from each campus that are all blockchain enthusiasts.
